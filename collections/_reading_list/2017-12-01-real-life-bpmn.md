This book helped me greatly while I was searching for a clean notation for communicating workflows within dev teams, operational teams, and with execs.  The authors provide an opinionated guide to which parts of BPMN are useful as well as a style that you can adopt from day 1.  Having a single notation that I could use to capture a strategic and operational model was key.  It's also a natural fit with message-based systems.  The authors also provide some great [free tools](https://camunda.com/products/modeler/) for building models.
