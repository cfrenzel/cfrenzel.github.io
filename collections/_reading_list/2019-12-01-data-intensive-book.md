I love the style of this book.  It's broad in scope, but it tries to build understanding on first principles.  Whether you consider your work "intensive" or not, if your working with data/databases this book is full of useful concepts.  Also checkout [Martin's Blog](https://martin.kleppmann.com/).  It's a great resource for distributed system concepts.
