Was going through some old video and found rough demo of a prototype that I built back in 2009. I was experimenting with AR at the time but nothing really came of it; so I thought I'd throw it up here.  The prototype uses a webcam under a sheet of glass to track markers on the bottom of blocks.  Here I'm experimenting with the layout of some office furniture.
