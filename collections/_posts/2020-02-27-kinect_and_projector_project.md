Found some more footage that I thought was pretty cool from back in 2013. This uses a microsoft kinect to track people at a party.  I used Quartz Composer to build some visuals and projected it realtime on the side of a barn.  Some of the visualizations are influenced by the audio, but I never got much going with body tracking.  Might have to expand on this one in the future.
